## Generating Mass Data.ipynb
Creating fake data of 50 projects, with data based on the  first four files, to show the possibility of creating a model for predicting  project prices, which will be based on the company's 50 projects

## Creating a Prediction Model.ipynb
After converting IFC, RVT files into JSON-CSV formats, we can create prediction models. In this example, we accepted that all the project data that are saved in one CSV file we can equate the price of the project. So having for example 50 typical projects with known price we can predict price of 51 projects - 4_1house_R.csv: with new set of parameters by parametric data in CSV file.
